# COMP1536_Assignment_4_Car

The fourth assignment for BCIT's COMP 1536 (Introduction to Web Development).

Students were required to draw a realistic car and animate smoke using JavaScript.

In this assignment, I learned how to:
  - Inject JavaScript into HTML pages
  - Combine HTML's canvas element and JavaScript to dynamically draw graphics using lines, paths, rectangles, and arcs
  - Apply solid and gradient colours to shapes
  - Create JavaScript function definitions
  - Target HTML elements using getElementById()
  - Animate portions of the page using JavaScript
  - Use the set and clear interval and timeout functions
  - Use and obtain the output generated from the range input type to make internal calculations to control the animation
