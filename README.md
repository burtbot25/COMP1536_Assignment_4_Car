# COMP1536_Assignment_4_Car

The fourth assignment for BCIT's COMP 1536 (Introduction to Web Development).

This assignment required students to draw a realistic car and animate smoke using JavaScript.

I learned how to combine HTML's canvas element and JavaScript to dynamically draw graphics using lines, paths, rectangles, arcs, as well as apply solid and gradient colours to these shapes.  Furthermore, this project allowed me to learn and understand the use of JavaScript fucntion definitions, use the getElementById() function to target HTML elements, use the set and clear interval and timeout functions, and use and obtain the output generated from the range input type to make internal calculations to control the animation.
